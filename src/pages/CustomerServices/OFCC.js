                    Your recruitment job posting and outreach must adhere to
                    OFCCP guidelines if you are a federal contractor and
                    subcontractor. Leading companies choose Vannova over all
                    others for quick, efficient, and cost-effective manual job
                    posting services because they are OFCCP compliant.

                    Working with a one-stop employment portal can be most
                    efficient because each state has its own distinct career
                    site, procedures of approving job ads, and record keeping
                    data standards. Federal contractors can alleviate some of
                    this burden by turning to experts in OFCCP compliance,
                    freeing them up to focus on other affirmative action
                    strategies.

                    OFCCP job listing requirements mandate that a contractor
                    that has a contract over $100K (60-300) or 50K (60-250) must
                    comply with mandatory job listing requirements. All jobs are
                    to be distributed and made available to all qualified
                    individuals, except for: (1) Executive positions (2)
                    positions lasting 3 days or less (3) positions filled
                    internally. To ensure that job listing requirements are met,
                    job posting should be sent to a wide variety of locations,
                    including OneStop centers, Veteran’s representatives,
                    Community Based Organizations, Educational Institutions and
                    departments of Vocational Rehabilitation. We acquire 100
                    percent of your job content every night and automatically

                    sites and agencies for approval and publication. Unlike any
                    other compliance provider, we receive automatic,
                    state-issued confirmation receipts to ensureyour listings
                    are live and published inside your registered workforce
                    account. Our unmatched tracking technology records all job
                    listing content and activity, so you can easily pull reports
                    in the event of an audit, and prove you’re meeting the
                    proper regulations to the highest standards. This includes
                    screenshots of every transaction (add / edit or delete) that
                    takes place. Redwood’s OFCCP Compliance gives employers and
                    technology partners distinct advantages for OFCCP
                    compliance. No other job service touting OFCCP benefits can
                    say the same about their offerings.
